"""Keep main-canvas PDIC editors coherent with edits made in proofreading.

Main canvas widgets and ReviewWindow rows edit the same Entry objects, but
Tk widgets keep their own text buffers. An old canvas widget can otherwise
write its stale text back on FocusOut or at the next autosave, including after
section-aware proofreading has saved correctly.
